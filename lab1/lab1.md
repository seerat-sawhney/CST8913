## LAB 1: Migration Requirements Gathering  
**Migration Plan for Home Trust Co.**

### 1. What are the company's motivators for migration to the cloud?

#### Reasons for Migrating to Azure:
- **Cost Efficiency**: Home Trust was dealing with high expenses and the challenges of maintaining their old VMware infrastructure and previous cloud solution. Switching to Azure VMware Solution allowed them to reduce these costs and eliminate the complexities of frequent hardware and software updates.
- **Enhanced Reliability and Recovery**: They needed a more reliable system that could quickly recover from issues. Azure’s managed service provided built-in redundancy and scalability, which improved their system’s stability and dependability.
- **Improved Performance**: The transition to Azure VMware Solution led to significant performance enhancements, enabling Home Trust to launch products faster and run operations more smoothly.
- **Adopting Modern Technologies**: The move to Azure opened opportunities for Home Trust to leverage advanced technologies and services like Azure Databricks and Power BI, which supported their digital transformation and business expansion.

- What are the specific compliance and security requirements they have, especially given their role in the financial sector?
- What’s their budget for both the migration process and the ongoing cloud management?
- How fast do they want to complete the migration?
- What type of support are they expecting from Bell Canada and Microsoft?
